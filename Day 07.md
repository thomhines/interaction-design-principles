1. **Refine Comps**

	You guys have a lot of great ideas in your designs so far, but there's obviously a *ton* to do over the next couple weeks. I want to see significant progress by next class. More pages, more details, and start to think about motion and interactivity a bit more. It's not required that your site have lots of cool, slick movements, but sometimes movement and pacing can enable you to better use space and enhance the user experience. Don't forget to update the blog with your work!


	
2. **Create InVision Prototype**

	By next Monday I want you to have a complete clickable prototype of your Project 1 in InVision. So, by next class, get started on it and post a link off your InVision prototype to the blog.
