### Work Session





HW
---------------------------------------


1. **Refine Comps**

	You guys have a lot of great ideas in your designs so far, but there's still quite a bit to do over the next couple weeks. I want to see significant progress by next class. Each of you needs to focus on different things, so do whatever it takes for you to get ahead. More wireframes, more pages, more details; focus on the big stuff and work down from there. Don't forget to update the blog with your work! 


2. **Practice keynote animations**

	Here's a good chance to start to think about motion and interactivity a bit more. It's not required that your app have lots of cool, slick movements, but sometimes movement and pacing can enable you to better use space and enhance the user experience. If you have time, export your keynote to video and upload it to Vimeo, then post your video link to the blog. Show us what you got!
