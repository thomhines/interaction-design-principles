CLASS
---------------------------------------

#### Quiz
Based on Rules of Play, Chapter 6 (Interaction)
- What is interactivity? (could be based on a number of definitions on Page 2, or one of the four modes: 1) Cognitive interactivity; or interpretive participation, 2) Functional interactivity; or utilitarian participation, 3) Explicit interactivity; or participation with designed choices and procedures, 4) Beyond-the-object-interactivity; or participation within the culture of the object)

- What is meant by "meaningful" interactions? (one in which a player/user has *choice*, actions lead directly to real outcomes)
	- What are some examples, from the book or otherwise?

- What are the difference between tactics and strategy?


- What is the "anatomy" of an interaction? (What happened before, how the choice is conveyed to the user, how does the user make their choice, what is the result of the choice, and how is the result conveyed to the user)

- What are some of the things that can lead to a failure in meaningful play? (Feeling as if decisions are arbitrary. Not knowing what to do next. Losing a game without knowing why. Not knowing if an action had an outcome.)





### Discuss Interactivity, Game Mechanics, and Meaningful Choice


- War
	- What are the game mechanics? What are the types of interactions (according to the four modes)?
	- What choices do the users have?
	- Do the actions feel meaningful despite that?

- Love Letter (or Dalmuti)
	- What choices do the users have?
	- Are there times where choices are restricted?
	- How are these choices meaningful?
	- What are the game mechanics? What are the types of interactions (according to the four modes)?


### Play Testing
Split Groups up into teams of 3, and then have them play test their games.




### Introduce Project 2

Using at least two of the game items (dice, cards, chess board, go board, scrabble tiles, rummikub tiles, maps, tokens, poker chips, character pieces, etc.), create a new game that uses both mechanics to create the randomly chosen emotion (fear, anger, anxiety, happiness, etc.) that each group received.

NOTE: Games should be able to be played in 20 minutes!






HW
---------------------------------------

1. **[Read This Article on Making Shitty Game Prototypes](https://medium.com/maxistentialism-blog/prototyping-secret-hitler-4ef23ccf727b#.62fkcn630)**

2. **[Read This Other Article](https://ericzimmerman.wordpress.com/2014/08/11/how-i-teach-game-design-lesson-2-broken-games-and-meaningful-play/) Then Fix a broken game**

This lesson comes from the author of the textbook we read from over the weekend. The assignment he poses to his students (and which I pose to you) is to fix a broken game. Make a better system. Insert meaningful choices. Take one of the games mentioned in the post and then find some way to make it less sucky. As opposed to the author, though, I'm totally fine with you taking your ideas far from the original concept. Keep some kind of connection, but make the best game you can in two days.

And have fun!
