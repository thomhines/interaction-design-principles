#### Quiz
Based on Rules of Play, Chapter 6 (Interaction)
- What is interactivity? (could be based on a number of definitions on Page 2, or one of the four modes: 1) Cognitive interactivity; or interpretive participation, 2) Functional interactivity; or utilitarian participation, 3) Explicit interactivity; or participation with designed choices and procedures, 4) Beyond-the-object-interactivity; or participation within the culture of the object)

- What is meant by "meaningful" interactions? (one in which a player/user has *choice*)
	- What are some examples, from the book or otherwise?

- What is the "anatomy" of an interaction? (What happened before, how the choice is conveyed to the user, how does the user make their choice, what is the result of the choice, and how is the result conveyed to the user)

- What are some of the things that can lead to a failure in meaningful play? (Feeling as if decisions are arbitrary. Not knowing what to do next. Losing a game without knowing why. Not knowing if an action had an outcome.)




### Discuss Interactivity, Game Mechanics, and Meaningful Choice



- War
	- What are the game mechanics? What are the types of interactions (according to the four modes)?
	- What choices do the users have?
	- Do the actions feel meaningful despite that?

- Love Letter
	- What choices do the users have?
	- Are there times where choices are restricted?
	- How are these choices meaningful?
	- What are the game mechanics? What are the types of interactions (according to the four modes)?

- Settlers of Catan
	- What are the game Mechanics?
	- What aspects do the players have control over?
	- How is this balanced?
	- Does this game have a positive or a negative feedback loop?

- Dominion
	- What choices do the users have?
	- What are the mechanics of the game?



### Play Testing
Split Groups up into teams of 3, and then have them play test their games.


Team 1: 
Dylan
Sean
Tim W.

Team 2: 
Sadie
Tyler
Tim K.

Team 3: 
Megan
Danielle
Brian




### Introduce Project 2

Using at least two of the game items (dice, cards, chess board, go board, scrabble tiles, rummikub tiles, maps, tokens, poker chips, character pieces, etc.), create a new game that uses both mechanics to create the randomly chosen emotion (fear, anger, anxiety, happiness, etc.) that each group received.








HW
---------------------------------------

Next class is cancelled, so you have a week to finish today's homework. Enjoy your week and I can't wait to see what games you make for next class!


1. **Read [Rules of Play, Chapter 3](http://teaching.thomhines.com/resources/Rules_of_Play_Chapter_3.pdf)**

	These concepts will drive the way in which you construct your game's rules, so definitely read up on it as soon as you can.



1. **Create a Game**

	Using your game pieces and the emotion that is to guide your game, start working on the mechanics for your game. Without worrying about narrative or aesthetics, come to class next week with a playable game and a printed set of rules.
