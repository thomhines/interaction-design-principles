CLASS

#### Quiz
Based on Rules of Play, Chapter 6 (Interaction)
- What is interactivity? (could be based on a number of definitions on Page 2, or one of the four modes: 1) Cognitive interactivity; or interpretive participation, 2) Functional interactivity; or utilitarian participation, 3) Explicit interactivity; or participation with designed choices and procedures, 4) Beyond-the-object-interactivity; or participation within the culture of the object)

- What is meant by "meaningful" interactions? (one in which a player/user has *choice*, actions lead directly to real outcomes)
	- What are some examples, from the book or otherwise?

- What are the difference between tactics and strategy?


- What is the "anatomy" of an interaction? (What happened before, how the choice is conveyed to the user, how does the user make their choice, what is the result of the choice, and how is the result conveyed to the user)

- What are some of the things that can lead to a failure in meaningful play? (Feeling as if decisions are arbitrary. Not knowing what to do next. Losing a game without knowing why. Not knowing if an action had an outcome.)



### Discuss Indie Game: The Movie

- In Super Meat Boy (~36min), the designer talked about level design, such as making a level that is just a long gap that requires running to get over, or a solid wall that requires wall climbing. This builds skills through design (instead of text), and gives the user a bigger sense of mastery since they figured it out themselves.

- Fez: It's easy to get caught up in endless iterations. Don't let the perfect become the enemy of the necessary.




### Discuss Interactivity, Game Mechanics, and Meaningful Choice


- War
	- What are the game mechanics? What are the types of interactions (according to the four modes)?
	- What choices do the users have?
	- Do the actions feel meaningful despite that?

- Love Letter
	- What choices do the users have?
	- Are there times where choices are restricted?
	- How are these choices meaningful?
	- What are the game mechanics? What are the types of interactions (according to the four modes)?

- Dominion
	- What choices do the users have?
	- What are the mechanics of the game?



### Play Testing
Split Groups up into teams of 3, and then have them play test their games.


Team 1: 

Elya
Denise
Christina
Brad



Team 2: 

Shannon
Jamon
Rudy


Team 3: 

Cameron
Sam
Sofia
Collin


Team 4: 
Richard
Erin
Steph




### Introduce Project 2

Using at least two of the game items (dice, cards, chess board, go board, scrabble tiles, rummikub tiles, maps, tokens, poker chips, character pieces, etc.), create a new game that uses both mechanics to create the randomly chosen emotion (fear, anger, anxiety, happiness, etc.) that each group received.

NOTE: Games should be able to be played in 20 minutes!






HW
---------------------------------------

1. **Create a Game**

	As a team, come up with a game that uses both dice and cards *effectively*. Remember what we talked about in class regarding what role each of those mechanics has on how a player plays. Beyond that, consider how you can use time, strategy, public/private information, meaningful choice, different interactive modes, etc. You aren't restricted from using other games' pieces, but if you build them into the rules, make sure you bring them to class so we can play test with them.
