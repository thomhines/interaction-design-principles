For the two groups who were in class yesterday, great work! I am *so* impressed by the changes you've made and the way you've addressed your previous issues. The games were very fun. And for the group who wasn't here yesterday, I'm afraid you may have missed your last chance for feedback before our final next week! No class on Wednesday!


1. Finish the Project!

	No need to do the game box, but you should have designed at least your board, pieces, cards, and game rules. You will be evaluated on your graphic design and craft, so don't leave this until the last second. Bring in a complete, finished, and playable version of your game to our final next week (Wed. June 11, 12:30pm).


2. Evaluate Your Group

	In order to get a sense of how everyone in your group contributed to Project 2, I would like for you all to [fill out this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1YndKGsHVZOC6I69Ef3fTNo2MzG7rPs1jWIyKCMwrx_s/viewform). Please be honest. I'm not going to grade you based on whether or not you guys worked well together, but I don't want somebody getting credit for someone else's work.


3. Evaluate Me!

	If you haven't done so already, I'd also really like if you could take the time to take care of your teacher evaluations before the end of the week! This is my first time teaching this class, and I sincerely do want to know how I can make it better for you all!


Have a great week and I'll see you all at the Final! Good luck, everyone!
