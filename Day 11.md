### Final Crits






HW
---------------------------------------

You guys did GREAT on your first project. I couldn't be more pleased. And now that that's done, it's GAME TIME!!!

Here's your homework for next class:

1. **Project 1 Self-Evaluation**

	Write 2-3 paragraphs about your thoughts on Project 1. You can focus on the project itself (the constraints, exercises, process, homework, etc.), or on your own personal experiences (how you felt you did, what you wish you did differently, what you liked, what you hated, etc.). Post this to the blog.


2. **Read [Emotion and Flow](http://boxesandarrows.com/design-for-emotion-and-flow/)**

	To get us started on thinking about games and their effects, I want you guys to read this article on "Flow". There'll be a quiz next class, so be ready!


3. **Play a Game**

	It can be any kind of game. Just play one. And do your best to win. :)
