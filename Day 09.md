#### Quiz
Based on [Shades of Discoverability](http://alistapart.com/column/shades-of-discoverability)

- What is meant by "discoverability" in web or UI design?
- What are some examples of "implicit cues"? (Static visual cues (affordances), motion, audio, text (eg. "Address Book" implies contacts, management, etc.))
- What does the author think of giving too many cues?

		Once you’ve handled your most important features, look for elegant ways to explain the availability and function of mid-level features. Drip these introductions in as they’re required, rather than trying to convey everything within the first minute. This progressive disclosure allows users to build up their mental models over time: any modern console game will provide instructive examples. Also consider different ways to provide implicit cues. Motion, audio, and text could all make your app more understandable without visual untidiness.


Based on [Visceral Apps and You](http://mysterioustrousers.com/news/2013/3/25/visceral-apps-and-you)
- What are the elements of a visceral app, according to the author? (build up and release, potential and kinetic energy, destruction)
- *Why* do we want to make apps that are visceral? (It connects with people on a more subconscious level; kind of like the examples from Malcolm Gladwell's *Blink*)

- What are some apps/sites that have these kinds of moments for you? Does the site your working on for Project 1 have any of these elements?
	Mention [Little Big Details](http://littlebigdetails.com/)


#### Discussion
- Visceral elements are great for bringing people in and making good apps great, but they need to have the right cues and structure for them to be a long-term success.


### Test InVision Prototypes

One-on-one. Switch users at least once.

### Practice Presentations

Practice in front of small group. Get feedback.

### Work



HW
---------------------------------------

1. **Read [Shades of Discoverability](http://alistapart.com/column/shades-of-discoverability)**

2. **Finish Rough Draft Presentation**

	We're going to practice presenting Project 1 next class, so make sure you have a clear idea of what you want to talk about and enough screens in as many states as you need to talk about them. These don't have to be polished, but we're getting too close to the end for you not to have these pretty close to nailed down.


Good luck and see you Wednesday!
