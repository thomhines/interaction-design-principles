CLASS
---------------------------------------

### Play
- Settlers of Catan
	- What are the game Mechanics?
	- What aspects do the players have control over?
	- How is this balanced?
	- Does this game have a positive or a negative feedback loop?

### Play Tests
One group at a time plays while the others watch and critique

- What parts of the game lead to Flow?
- What are the limitations of the game system? Or what feels unbalanced?
- What can be done to remove those limitations or add balance?


### Start Project 2

- Come up with list of emotions/feelings
	- fear, happiness, caring, anxiety, aggression, anger, regret, superiority, judgment, calm, 
	- six basic emotions: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness and surprise (from [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion#Basic_emotions))

- Come up with list of key game mechanics (from [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_mechanics#Combination_conditions))
	- luck, speed, skill, strategy, information, auction/bidding, characters, movement, resource management, risk, capture/eliminate, cooperation, teams, victory points, positive/negative feedback loop, loss avoidance


- Have students randomly pick one emotion and two mechanics, then they can start to work on the game that utilizes all three into one game.





HW
---------------------------------------


1. **Read this [Article](https://ericzimmerman.wordpress.com/2014/08/11/how-i-teach-game-design-lesson-2-broken-games-and-meaningful-play/)**


2. **Create 3 Game Ideas**

	Based on your two chosen game mechanics, create three game ideas that would cause your chosen emotion in your game's players. You don't have to create all the rules; instead, write a one paragraph synopsis of each. These games can involve special pieces (tokens, dice, cards, maps, boards, tiles, etc.). Each group only needs to post one set of 3 ideas.


3. **Refine 1 Game**

	Take one of the game ideas and start to form a game that integrates your mechanics and emotions in a *meaningful* way. Post your rules to the blog (once for each group)—along with any images that might be necessary—and bring all necessary game items to the next class.
