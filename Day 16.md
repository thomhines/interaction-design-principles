ART 299 - Day 16
=======================================

1. Play Test Games




PREP
---------------------------------------
- Bring games
- Set up repeaterrrr timer



CLASS
---------------------------------------

### Discuss Strategy
- What is the difference between tactics and strategy? What are some examples? (eg. Using your cards to build a settlement in Settlers is a tactic toward the strategy of using those resources to build a city later in the game)
- What did you do to incorporate strategy into your games? What are the rules of your variants?
- What are the general ways in which you can build strategy into a game?
	- Decrease chance and risk (Allow users more control over their actions so that their actions have more consequence)
	- Provide balance to all actions (Every action should have strengths and weaknesses so that every choice would make sense to use at some point)
	- Increase the consequences and rewards of actions
	- Actions should have effects that are permanent or take place over time (Like chess, each action should change the 'state' of the game so that future actions are constrained or influenced by them)




### Play Test Games

- If one group is finished and ready to play test, then one other group plays their game and the game makers take note. The third group can work on their game for a while. After that, group 2 gets to work while group 1 plays group 3's game. And then group 3 will play group 2's game.
- If not, all groups work for the first hour and play happens in the last two hours. Make whatever pieces and things are needed for a group to play their game, and have *complete* rules listed out.
- Split remaining time into thirds so each team gets the same amount of time.
Make a [repeaterrrr](repeaterrrr.com) timer that includes time for feedback?



Remaining time? Play Dominion.




HW
---------------------------------------
Nice work today, guys! I *love* the ideas that you guys are playing with so far, and I see a lot of potential here. I hope you had fun playing your games and seeing how others interacted with them. Here's your homework for next week.


1. **Refine Game**

	Based on your observations of the play test from class, make a list of your core mechanics and evaluate which ones were most successful and which ones were most problematic. From there, adjust your game rules to create better engagement and balance and post your updated rules to blog.


2. **Start Creating Assets**

	Since time is somewhat limited and we only have a couple of class sessions left, now is when we need to start considering the aesthetic and compositional aspects of our games. By next class, I want you to come up with a name for your game, a rough logo, a mood board, and start designing the elements of your game. If your game has a board, make that. If your game uses dice, can you design dice that feel more appropriate to the game you're playing? Create a rough draft of as much of the game as you can. Post all of these to the blog, as well.


3. **Play Test Your Game**

	After you've updated your rules, play the game yourselves, and then find a small group of friends or strangers to try your game as well. Remember, help your play testers understand the explicit rules of your game, but try to stay away from giving implicit rules or strategies for winning. If they don't come out on their own, then that's worth noting. Take notes on your observations and post them to the blog.
