ART 299 - Day 16
=======================================

1. Play Test Games




PREP
---------------------------------------
- Bring games
- Set up repeaterrrr timer



CLASS
---------------------------------------


### Discuss Strategy
- What is the difference between tactics and strategy? What are some examples? (eg. Using your cards to build a settlement in Settlers is a tactic toward the strategy of using those resources to build a city later in the game)
- What did you do to incorporate strategy into your games? What are the rules of your variants?
- What are the general ways in which you can build strategy into a game?
	- Decrease chance and risk (Allow users more control over their actions so that their actions have more consequence)
	- Provide balance to all actions (Every action should have strengths and weaknesses so that every choice would make sense to use at some point)
	- Increase the consequences and rewards of actions
	- Actions should have effects that are permanent or take place over time (Like chess, each action should change the 'state' of the game so that future actions are constrained or influenced by them)



### Play Great Dalmuti

- How does it involve strategy? How does it involve the 4 general ways mentioned earlier (allow users ways to decrease chance and risk, provide balance, increase consequence/rewards, actions have permanent/long-term effects)





### Play Test Games

- If one group is finished and ready to play test, then one other group plays their game and the game makers take note. The third group can work on their game for a while. After that, group 2 gets to work while group 1 plays group 3's game. And then group 3 will play group 2's game.
- If not, all groups work for the first hour and play happens in the last two hours. Make whatever pieces and things are needed for a group to play their game, and have *complete* rules listed out.
- Split remaining time into thirds so each team gets the same amount of time.
Make a [repeaterrrr](repeaterrrr.com) timer that includes time for feedback?



Remaining time? Play Dominion.




HW
---------------------------------------
Nice work today, guys! I *love* the ideas that you guys are playing with so far, and I see a lot of potential here. I hope you had fun playing your games and seeing how others interacted with them. Here's your homework for next week. (Remember: no class on Monday!)


1. **Refine Game**

	Based on your observations of the play test from class, make a list of your core mechanics and evaluate which ones were most successful and which ones were most problematic. From there, adjust your game rules to create better engagement and balance and post your updated rules to blog. This will probably involve significant changes, so make your game pieces cheap and easy so that you can iterate quickly.


2. **Start Creating Visual Assets**

	Since time is somewhat limited and we only have a couple of class sessions left, now is when we need to start considering the aesthetic and compositional aspects of our games. By next class, I want you to come up with a name for your game, a rough logo, a mood board, and start designing the elements of your game. If your game has a board, start designing that. If your game uses dice, try to create dice that feel more appropriate to the game you're playing or give more useful information than just a number. Post all of these to the blog.


3. **Play Test Your Game**

	After you've updated your rules, play the game yourselves, and then find a small group of friends or strangers to try your game as well. Remember, help your play testers understand the explicit rules of your game, but try to stay away from giving implicit rules or strategies for winning. If they don't come out on their own, then that's worth noting. Take notes on your observations and *post them to the blog*.


4. **Group Evaluations**

	Based on the group work to date, fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1kqTzlRm8ebRxVfSBXW7sq0odR3taF5J2KXB83iKiaRw/viewform?usp=send_form) to give me a sense of how the project is going so far and how you feel each of the members of your team are doing. These are confidential, and I won't be grading you down because you might be having some group dynamics issues. These are so I can see and help address those issues, as well as ensure that everybody is pulling their own weight.
