### Quiz
Based on [How to do a Product Critique](https://medium.com/the-year-of-the-looking-glass/how-to-do-a-product-critique-98b657050638):

- What are the main periods of time that the author focuses on when evaluating an app (before you open it, the first few minutes, and weeks/months after)
- What are some of the main considerations when critiquing an app (What’s the experience of getting started or signing up? How easy to use was the app? )


#### Discussion

Some highlights:
- What’s your one-line summary of what this app does at this stage?
	
	Being able to define what your app does concisely is key to understand its core functionality. And anything beyond that core functionality just adds to the risk that your app will lose any sort of focus and be hard to be understood by its users.

- How does this app compare to other similar apps?
	
	Knowing your competition will keep your work more original, while allowing you to work from the best ideas and leave behind the things that don't work. If you look at other people's sites as prototypes of your own, you can test your ideas without having to build a thing.

- "Great experiences doesn’t just happen by happenstance. The best designers and product thinkers know people."
	
	Read this whole paragraph to the class.



### Housekeeping
- Have people change their WP name to their full name (if necessary)
- Sign Up for Be Honest
- Questions?






### Discuss Site Objectives

Split into small groups and compare/contrast these sites:
	
- [nytimes.com](http://nytimes.com)  vs.  [bbc.com](http://bbc.com/)
- [reddit.com](http://reddit.com)  vs.  [pinterest](http://pinterest.com)
- [craigslist](http://craigslist.com)  vs  [ebay](http://ebay.com)


#### Questions
- Who are their primary users? secondary?
- What is each site's main objectives?
- Why would there be differences between them?
- Which site would be more usable by your grandma?
- Overall thoughts?


#### Grade each site (1-10):
- hierarchy
- navigation
- aesthetics
- user experience

HW
---------------------------------------

Another fun discussion today, everyone! I'm really impressed with the insights you were able to pull out from looking at your sites. Now we'll start to focus more on Project 1. 

Hope you all have a great weekend!


1. **Site Critique**

	Answer all of the questions in this week's reading ([How to do a Product Critique](https://medium.com/the-year-of-the-looking-glass/how-to-do-a-product-critique-98b657050638)) for your chosen Project 1 site. Post your answers/notes to WordPress.


2. **Feature Inventory**

	List out all of the features that your Project 1 web app has, break them into categories of those that help your users achieve their main objective and those that don't. Next, look at how your app's competitors handle these tasks and see what aspects from them could be most useful in your design. Post to the blog, along with screen shots and sketches if helpful. This will be your list of possible features that you can incorporate into your designs.


3. **Check out [Original And Innovative Web Layouts](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/08/29/innovative-appraoches-web-layout/)**


4. **3 Sets of Wireframes**
	
	I want to see three distinct directions. You don't have to design the login screens or anything else that you'll see in most other apps, but I do want to see the layout and core interactions for the main aspects of your app.

	Consider different layouts, different interactions, and different affordances in each direction. Minimum of 5 frames per direction (15 frames total), and don't waste time on details or anything that won't help you get your ideas down on paper.

MAKE SURE TO INCLUDE YOUR GRID
