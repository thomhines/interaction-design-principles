#### Questions
- Overall thoughts?
- Who are their users? 
- What is each site's main objectives?
- Why would there be differences between them?
- Which site would be more usable by your grandma?


#### Grade each site (1-10):

###### BREAK


### Site Questionnaires

- Site Questionnaires are great for understand the big picture elements of a client's needs. This is especially important so that you, as the designer, can maintain a certain amount of perspective and help control the direction the project takes.

- Go over everybody's site ideas

- Have each student pick one direction and answer these questions to get to the root of what they want their site to do:

	1. What problem is your app trying to solve?
	2. What are the top three objectives for your app?
	3. Who is your primary audience? Do you have a secondary one?
	4. What do these different groups of users need for the app to do? In other words, how do they use the app currently?
	5. Who are your app's competitors (list at least three)? What are their main features? What makes them unique?
	6. What is the bare minimum that *your* app needs to be functional? Would this be enough to make a useful app?



### Wireframes

Do: 
- Get all major content in the page
- Provide structure
- Indidate necessary design patterns

Don't: 
- Pick colors
- Pick fonts
- Adjust margins
- Nitpick




HW
---------------------------------------


1. **Finish Questionnaire**

	If you weren't here or weren't able to fininsh this in class, please copy and paste the questions from [this post](http://art342s14.wordpress.com/2014/04/02/project-1-objectives-questionnaire/) into a new post on the blog, answer the questions and hit the publish button. These questions should be answered about the web site/app that you are going to be re-designing for Project 1. 


2. **Feature Inventory**

	List out all of the features that your app has, break them into categories of those that help your users achieve their main objective and those that don't. Next, look at how your app's competitors handle these tasks and see what aspects from them could be most useful in your design. Post to the blog, along with screen shots and sketches if helpful.


3. **3 Sets of Wireframes**
	
	I want to see three distinct directions. You don't have to design the login screens or anything else that you'll see in most other apps, but I do want to see the layout and core interactions for the main aspects of your app.

	Consider different layouts, different interactions, and different affordances in each direction. Minimum of 5 frames per direction (15 frames total).
