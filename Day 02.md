Day 2
=======================================

1. Discuss Principles of User Interface Design
2. Discuss what makes for a poor UI
3. Considerations for Mobile Design


PREP
---------------------------------------
- Get URLs loaded in browser (nytimes.com, bbc.com, reddit, pinterest, craigslist, ebay, family tree sites, past student examples)



CLASS
---------------------------------------

### Quiz 
Based on Behaviors:
- What are the three elements necessary for someone to take an action? (motivation, ability, trigger)
- What do you have to do to improve these three factors for your users? (understand your users, ask the "whys" to get to the reasons behind their needs)
- How can we increase motivation? (showing how great the product can be through photos or telling a good stroy)
- How can we increase ability? (focus on who your user is, and provide them means of fixing the one factor standing in the way: Money, Time, Energy, Social Pressure, Familiarity, and Brain Cycles)
- How can we increase triggers? (gamification)

Based on Interaction Design Best Practices, Chap. 1:
- What is User Experience (how much a user can enjoy a specific interaction, and how that enjoyment extends into the entire experience)
- What are the five pillars of Interaction design (goal-driven design, usability, affordances and signifiers, learnability, feedback and response time)
- What are five ways you can improve an interaction? (roleplay the interaction, map out the narrative, simplify the steps, limit user choices, pay attention to micromoments (hesitations when the user isn't sure what to do))

"Interaction design isn’t about how interfaces behave, it’s about how people behave, and then adapting technology accordingly."




#### Discussion



### Housekeeping
- Have people change their WP name to their full name (if necessary)
- Sign Up for Be Honest
- Questions?




### Talk about Project 1 apps and objectives (3 objectives per app)

- What is the main objective of your app?
- What is the main problem with your app that you are trying to solve?
- What are you doing to solve it?
- Who are your users?


### Personas
[Based on this article from UXBooth](http://www.uxbooth.com/articles/creating-personas/) and [this one from usability.gov](http://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/personas.html)

1. Start with what your goals are
	- What is the purpose of the app?
	- What are the goals of the app?

2. Define who your people are (create 3, one for each main feature)
	- Age
	- Gender
	- Interests
	- Job
	- Location
	- Technology

3. What are their needs and motivations? How does this tie into your app?



### User Flows

- Go over [a shorthand for designing UI flows](http://37signals.com/svn/posts/1926-a-shorthand-for-designing-ui-flows)

- Have students read [Keeping the goal in sight while designing component flows](http://feltpresence.com/articles/17-keeping-the-goal-in-sight-while-designing-component-flows)

Students can go on break after they finish the article.

#### Break


- Discuss:
	- What was Ryan Singer trying to do on the website (ie. What was his objective?)? (to watch a video online)
	- What was the website he was using try to get him to do (ie. What was the site's implied objective)? (to have users log in or create accounts)
	- How did Ryan propose solving it? (Instead of having user reset password, just send a verification email to the user, then let them proceed from there straight to the video)
	- What did he see as the core reason that the site didn't do this to begin with? (Basic requirements are set out, and then split for separate people to tackle. UX and user flow were separated)


- Go through example: Buying a book on Amazon

	- Write down process in words
	- Convert into user flow

Have students work on this in class.



### User Flow Paper Prototypes


### POP Demo



### Invision Demo

- Sign Up for InVision
	Go to the InVision [Education](http://www.invisionapp.com/education-signup) site and use the activation code 56-73-13-19 to sign up for an account. InVision is giving our class an expanded 'Free' account. Feel free to play around with it if you want; we'll be using this software to make some interactive prototypes next week, so be ready to get going by the start of next class.

- Import wireframes
- Make clickable prototype
- Show how they can share their prototype

Have students work on their own demos, then let each other try them out in class.








HW
---------------------------------------

Another fun discussion today, everyone! I'm really impressed with the insights you were able to pull out from looking at your sites. Now we'll start to focus more on Project 1. 

Hope you all have a great weekend!


1. **Read [Principles of Interface Design](http://bokardo.com/principles-of-user-interface-design/)**

	Building on today's discussion and planning ahead to building usable apps, this list of principles is a fantastic summary of what makes good UI.


2. **Create Three Personas**

	Define three imaginary people who can embody the various needs your users might have. Try to pick people who aren't the same. No matter how simple your app is, no doubt people use it for different reasons. The more you can articulate these users needs, the easier the next steps will be. Here are some examples of some overly designed (but good) [personas on Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/kooj/personas/).


4. **Written User Steps**

	Using words, broadly describe what the user is doing and why they're doing it, from beginning to end. If there are multiple ways a user can use your site, go through each process individually.


5. **Component/User Flows**

	Using the method that Ryan Singer pointed out in today's article (and linked to below) and your written user steps, draw out the user flows for at least the three main forms of interaction that your site will have. If your users have a lot of options or choices at a given point, try your best to get all of them, but go for the options that are used by the most users; too much detail can sometimes be worse that too little.


6. **Make InVision or PoP Click Thru Prototype**

	If you haven't already, get [Prototyping on Paper](https://popapp.in/) installed on your phone and create a clickable prototype of your app. We'll be playing with these on Monday, so bring your phone with you. 

	If you don't have a smart phone or the app isn't compatible with your phone, go to the [InVision Education](http://www.invisionapp.com/education-signup) site and use the activation code 56-73-13-19 to sign up for an account. After you do, create a simple InVision prototype of your app by uploading images of your paper prototype and linking the buttons to each of your different screens. You might need to add a few labels on your wireframes so people can know what they're clicking. Post a link of your demo to the blog.
