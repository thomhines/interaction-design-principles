HW

You know what you have to do, so I'm not going to go into detail. Basically, finish your designs, make an AMAZING presentation, and practice that presentation at least twice before coming to class next week. You guys are doing stellar work, so make sure you see it through to the end. 

Best of luck to you all and I hope you have a great weekend!
