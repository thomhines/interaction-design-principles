(Remember: no class on Monday!)

Hey guys,

Just because there's only four of us to coordinate with, we can pick and choose our final time pretty easily. Let me know what times and days work better for you the week of June 6th and I'll put together a doodle poll to find the optimal time that works for everybody.

And between now and then, here's your homework:

1. **Finish Designing Your Game**

	This includes play-testing. With other people; it doesn't count if you do it alone. Post your play-test documentation and notes, along with your rules, to the blog.


2. **Make Your Rules**

	And you have to write all of the rules so that your game can be played without you being there to explain it. This can include illustrations and images if that helps. Once you've worked out the final kinks in your game, you probably won't want to change this too much. 


3. **First Draft Visual Designs - All Assets (Due End of Day Monday 5/30)**

	Design your pieces, your cards, your boards, your box, or whatever you need in your game. For the purposes of the design, you don't have to design EVERYTHING. Just enough so that we can comment on it and so that you can take some photos for your portfolio. This will be worth only 10 points, but not doing this on time will result in a -30. Seriously.

4. **Review Each Other's Designs (Due End of Day Tuesday 5/31)**

	In order to get some feedback during the week we are all away, I want you all to give feedback to your classmates blog posts for their rules and designs. Again, this will be worth only 10 points, but not doing this on time will result in a -30. 

5. **Finish Everything (Due at the Final)**

	Here's what you should bring on the final day:
	- A playable game (craft is not considered, and you don't have to print out all of the cards at high quality, but we should get a feel for what the game will REALLY be like)
	- Printed rule book (print one extra copy so I can keep it)
	- Your Game Face


Good luck over the next couple weeks guys! I can't wait to play your final games!
