Hey all,

Great discussion today, everyone. Lots of great ideas and I see a lot of potential in your projects. As you move forward, remember not to skip any steps. People all have different processes, but you miss important info and understanding. There's no expectation that you have a complete idea of what you're building yet. It's much better at this point to be trying things out and working hard in divergent ways. Keep up the good work and see you Wednesday!


1. **Read [7 Rules for Creating Gorgeous UI](https://medium.com/@erikdkennedy/7-rules-for-creating-gorgeous-ui-part-1-559d4e805cda) and [Part II](https://medium.com/@erikdkennedy/7-rules-for-creating-gorgeous-ui-part-2-430de537ba96)**

2. **Refine Comps**

	Choose one direction (or the best parts of multiple directions) and start to refine your ideas into a more complete version of your site. Design and post at least three of the more central and complex pages to the blog. And again, if you have a bunch of ideas, feel free to try different things on each page to see what it looks like and get some feedback. Don't limit yourselves too much this early in the process.
