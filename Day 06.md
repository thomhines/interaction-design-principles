HW
---------------------------------------

Great discussion today, you guys! It's so great to have a group that is so open to these design topics. Not many things to do this week. Focus on Project 1 and I'll see you all next week!



1. **Refine Comps**

	Keep pushing your designs. Take what we learned in class and see if you can heighten the aesthetics of your projects. By next class I want to see at least one version or "state" of each of the pages in your web app, and if you only have a few pages, then I want to see several states. We will start to play with prototyping user flows next week, so make sure you are ready to show how most of your app is going to work.
