### Quiz

- What are some of the rules for making pretty UI?

	1. Light comes from the sky
	2. Black and white first
	3. Double your whitespace
	4. Learn the methods of overlaying text on images
	5. Make text pop— and un-pop
	6. Only use good fonts
	7. Steal like an artist



> So word to the nerds: if I’m any good at designing UI now, it’s because I’ve analyzed stuff — not because I came out the chute with an intuitive understanding of beauty and balance.


### Analyzing Good Design
What makes for good design?
- Subtle use of color and depth
- Good fonts (shows character or quality) 
	- What fonts have you tried?
- Space/Pacing
- Hierarchy (Make more things bigger!!!)
- Clarity in purpose (one thing per page/section)
- Imagery
- Conventions









HW
---------------------------------------

Great discussion today, you guys! It's so great to have a group that is so open to these design topics. Not many things to do this weekend. Focus on Project 1 and I'll see you all next week!

1. **Check out examples of transitions, add to mood boards**


2. **Storyboard app flow**


3. **[Get Keynote](http://lifehacker.com/get-iwork-for-free-on-any-os-x-mavericks-machine-1469700860)**


4. **Refine Comps**

	Keep pushing your designs. Take what we learned in class and see if you can heighten the aesthetics of your projects. By next class I want to see at least one version or "state" of each of the pages in your web app, and if you only have a few pages, then I want to see several states. We will start to play with prototyping user flows next week, so make sure you are ready to show how most of your app is going to work.
