### Presenting UI

#### Tips on Presenting IxD
**from Hirumi Nanayakkara**


1.	Empathy. Your audience needs to emotionally connect to what you are pitching for you to sell it well. In order to that, you need to tell a really good story. What is the problem that your product is solving? Every great website/digital product tells a compelling story by interweaving thoughtful UI with meaningful interactions and gestures.  

2.	Identify the target demographic-- interview users, create personas, and go through user flows. I find that many people like to skip over this part, but its so so important

3.	Analysis-- competitive and comparative. You should know what is already out there and why your product is better than it, and also things that inspire you

4.	Prioritize features-- list out everything you and your users want your product to do and then prioritize. Designing for mobile first makes this easy, and also helps in cutting out bells + whistles that dont actually make your product better

5.	Wireframe + Prototype (Demonstrate effectiveness)-- simple paper prototyping or interactive PDFs can help you figure out what you need to build before wasting a lot of time coding/designing



#### Presentation Skeleton

I wouldn't say this is always the best way to frame a presentation, but this is what made the most sense for us to "sell the sizzle."

1. break down the concept so that its super easy to understand + remember

2. walk through a user scenario--make the audience connect with the app and concept and why its something they could see themselves or someone they know using

3. show that there is a need for this. for this particular concept, we were driven by the horrid gender biases of apps designed for women, and the few apps that we found to be inspiring

4. we then used real world data to show that validated our thinking

5. then it was time to show that there is a real world interest in the world of gardening--this touched on bigger concepts in digital gaming including the success of social responsibility in games like farmville, and also eco-feminism

6. then we talked about all the parameters we needed to meet for the class

7. then walked through the app interface

8. and validated our concept through showing interviews with people that would potentially endorse our idea if we won (eyebeam and the UN)

2. **Read [Visceral Apps and You](http://mysterioustrousers.com/news/2013/3/25/visceral-apps-and-you)** OR NOT


I didn't expect to give you guys so many tasks today, but most of these should be pretty quick. The bulk of your time should be on making your Project 1 comps, but do the other stuff too so you'll be all set when we turn in the final files. Plus, do it because I said so. :)


1. **Mission Statement**

	Create a 1 or 2-sentence mission statement for you app to act as an anchor for all of your design decisions moving forward. 


2. **Keep Going on Designs**

	We have just under two weeks, but I'm expecting greatness from these projects. Keep up the good work!

	
3. **Create InVision Prototype**

	By next Monday I want you to have the start of clickable prototype of your Project 1 in InVision. Using the Share button, post a link off your InVision prototype to the blog.


4. **Play With Keynote**

	Like I said in class, create at least one animation in your app that shows a transition from one state to another. There are some good examples in the links below.


5. **Create a Script Outline for Project 1 Presentation**

	First, read [13 Ways Designers Screw Up Presentations](http://muledesign.com/2014/09/13-ways-designers-screw-up-client-presentations). Then, start to outline what you is most important about your redesign and organize it into a script that addresses some of the issues that we talked about today in class (Build empathy; define your audience; provide analysis; indicate main features; demonstrate effectiveness). Don't just walk us through the steps necessary to log in or use your site; use those steps to illuminate *why* we would want to and how it is better than the alternative. You don't have to write a script verbatim, but you should have a clear outline for how you want to discuss your work. Post this to the blog.
