HW
---------------------------------------

1. **Read [7 Rules for Creating Gorgeous UI (Part 1)](https://medium.com/@erikdkennedy/7-rules-for-creating-gorgeous-ui-part-1-559d4e805cda#.z98be6qvb) and [Part 2](https://medium.com/@erikdkennedy/7-rules-for-creating-gorgeous-ui-part-2-430de537ba96#.bk72bhbcf)**


2. **Review an App**

	Find an app with good design, and write 10 things that make it good. We're looking at both visual design and user experience.


2. **3 Design Directions**

	Using your wireframes, user flows and mood boards, start to create some more aesthetically complete designs for your app. These can be a little rough, but should closely resemble a real app design. You should be experimenting with color, layout, typography, etc., and you can absolutely use a UI kit to get started. I want to see three very different design directions of your two most complex or central screens by next class. Post these to the blog. PROTIP: You will probably want to use the dimensions of your own phone for these designs.
