HW
---------------------------------------

1. **Download Keynote**

	If you don't have it already, make sure you download keynote from the Apple App store. If you have a PC, sign up for an iCloud account and boot up the iCloud version of Keynote.


2. **Play with transitions**

		For this part, you will actually need a Mac with Keynote installed. Take a Photoshop or Illustrator file and bring the various elements from it into Keynote. Next, create at least three slides with some sort of animation on each slide. [Here's the one I made] (http://teaching.thomhines.com/resources/animations%20demo.zip). Post a screenshot to the blog.


3. **3 Design Directions**

	Using your wireframes, user flows and mood boards, start to create some more aesthetically complete designs for your web site. These can be a little rough, but should closely resemble a real website design. You should be experimenting with color, layout, typography, etc. I want to see three quite varied design directions of one of your pages by next class. Post these to the blog.
