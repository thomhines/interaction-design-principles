### Quiz

- What is a persona?
- From the [reading we did in class](http://feltpresence.com/articles/17-keeping-the-goal-in-sight-while-designing-component-flows), what was wrong with the login process that Ryan Singer dealt with?
- Where did Ryan think that these problems came from (whose fault were they)?

Have students work on their own demos, then let each other try them out in class.


HW
---------------------------------------



1. **Read this article**
	
	[Behavior Design: The basics of how to design products that change people’s behavior.](https://medium.com/building-things-on-the-internet/be9d48aefeb0)


2. **Make InVision Prototype**

	If you haven't already, go to the InVision [Education](http://www.invisionapp.com/education-signup) site and use the activation code 56-73-13-19 to sign up for an account. After you do, create a simple InVision prototype of your wireframe site. You might need to add a few labels on your wireframes so people can know what they're clicking. Post a link of your demo to the blog.


3. **3 Design Directions**

	Using your wireframes, user flows and mood boards, start to create some more aesthetically complete designs for your web site. These can be a little rough, but should closely resemble a real website design. You should be experimenting with color, layout, typography, etc., and you can absolutely use a UI kit to get started. I want to see three very different design directions of your most complex or central page by next class. Post these to the blog.
