Day 12
=======================================

1. Final Crits




PREP
---------------------------------------
- Post Rules of Play, Chapter 6



CLASS
---------------------------------------

#### Quiz
Based on [Design for Emotion and Flow](http://boxesandarrows.com/design-for-emotion-and-flow/)
- What is "flow"?
- What are some of the things that define "flow"?
- How do we cause "flow"?
- And how can this be applied to design? (creating clear tasks/objectives, building arousal elements to the anxiety level of your users, expanding challenge and ability as proficiency increases)




### Play Games
- [Flappy Bird](http://www.freeflappybird.org/)
- Tic Tac Toe
- Banagrams
- Taboo

Discussion:
- Which games provide the closest thing to flow?
- What were the objectives?
- What about these games make them work or not?
- What are the kinds of choices players could make in each game?
- Why do we care as designers?



##### Break




### Discuss Flow and User Agency/Choice

In many ways, Flow = Good User Experience. 

 #### Games Homework
- What games did you guys play?
- Did anybody play a new game?
- How do you learn new games?
- What are the mechanics of the games you played?
- Which games used randomness?
- Which games used "perfect information" (all information is known to all players, eg. Chess) and which had "hidden information"?
- How did these affect the choices that users make? (perfect information games tend to pit players directly against one another, imperfect allow for intrigue, deception and mystery, but players make decisions without full knowledge)





### Go over [Super Mario Bros 3 Level Design Lessons](http://www.significant-bits.com/super-mario-bros-3-level-design-lessons)
Have students read traits as I play through the level on my screen.

- How is increasing complexity used to induce flow?
- How is increasing complexity used to increase skill level?






HW
---------------------------------------

Oh my! What a day! Games are fun. Hope you enjoyed them, too. Here's your homework for the weekend:

1. **Read [Rules of Play, Chapter 6 (Interactivity)](http://teaching.thomhines.com/resources/Rules%20of%20Play,%20Chapter%206.pdf)**

	Obviously we are designing games to better understand design in a broader sense. This chapter discusses the attributes of interaction and how they can create meaning within a game. We'll talk more about this next week.


2. **Watch Indie Game: The Movie**

	There are few documentaries that I've liked as much as this one. It doesn't just talk about the game design process; the ideas here are can easily be applied process for any creative endeavor. Plus, you get to watch a movie for homework.

	[Netflix](http://www.netflix.com/WiMovie/70229918?movieid=70229918&trkid=222336&strkid=1928561577_0_0) (free, requires account) | [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Indie-Game-Movie-Jonathan-Blow/dp/B008DGRG28) ($3)


3. **Make a Game**

	Take a game that only uses pencil and paper ([here](http://boardgames.about.com/od/paperpencil/) is a good list to draw from), and modify it's rules so that it encourages a state of flow. Write out the rules and post them to the blog.
