CLASS
---------------------------------------

#### Housekeeping

- What should we expect from every action in a game? (outcomes/feedback)


-----
SKIP
Based on Rules of Play, Chapter 3 ***MOVE THIS TO THE PREVIOUS WEEK***
- What are the three different kinds of rules? (Operational, Constitutive, Implicit)
	- What do each of these mean? (Operational = "Rules of play", stated rules. Constitutive = Mathematical rules behind game structure. Implicity = "unwritten rules", things like take backs, being quiet during someone else's turn, etc.)
- Which are the "real" rules of the game? (combo of Operational and Constitutive)
	- Which do you think comes first? Which comes last?
	- What gives a game its identity?
-----


### Games as systems of information, and social play
Game rules are the identity of a game
Games establish relationships between players
These relationships evolve as implicit rules emerge


#### Implicit Rules

Play Space Team
Play Resistance 

Afterwards:
- What are the rules of the game?
- What are the implied rules?
- What sort of relationship does the game force it's players to have?


Strategy:
Play these games:
- Stand Up (two people sit back to back and try to stand up. Then, a third person is added. Then a fourth...)
- Resistance
- Great Dalmuti






### Play Test Games
Each team gets to play another team's game while they watch. 
Split remaining time into thirds so each team gets the same amount of time.
Make a [repeaterrrr](repeaterrrr.com) timer that includes time for feedback?








HW
---------------------------------------
1. **Strategy Game Variants**

	Create two variants on your game that add to or heighten strategy within your game. Remember the difference between tactics and strategy. Focus on player choices that can have more long-term effects within the game. How can you control the effects of a player's actions? How can a player use their choices to create a different, more favorable state of the game? Write these game rules along with any necessary images and diagrams and post them to the blog.


2. **Create a Game Narrative**

	Write 2-3 paragraphs that describe the world in which your game takes place. What is the central conflict? Who are the main characters? What features of your world drive the action of the game? Post this to the blog as well.


3. **Bring Game Materials**

	Make sure you bring whatever you need in order to make and play your game next class. None of the materials need to be designed or anything, but you should have enough to play through your game by the end of the class period.
