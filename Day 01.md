HW
---------------------------------------

Welcome to the class, everyone! We'll start with some light homework, just to get moving into Project 1. Remember, post ALL of your homework to the blog!


1. **Read this Article**

	[Dude, I Redesigned Facebook](http://will-grounds.roon.io/dude-i-redesigned-facebook) 
	
	Be prepared to talk about this stuff next class! There will be a quiz!


2. **Pick a 3 Web Apps/Sites That You'd Like to Redesign**

	It can be any sites off the list on the Project 1 Brief, or choose your own. You'll probably have the most luck with a site that you use regularly. You're picking three just to have some back-ups. Post links to all three to the blog.
	
	Here are the links I showed today in class as inspiration:
	- [Facebook Redesign](http://nerby.com/project/facebook/)
	- [The Future of Airline Websites](http://www.f-i.com/fi/airlines/)


3. **3 Favorite Sites**
	
	Help us see what you like on the internet. Post screenshots and links to your three favorite websites (for any good reason) and write a paragraph or two on each for why it is.
