CLASS
---------------------------------------


### Sites vs. Apps

Split students into groups and have them discuss whether or not these things are sites or apps:

- Dropbox
- Pirate Bay
- Netflix
- Hulu
- Flickr
- Tumblr
- WordPress
- Evernote
- Mint
- PayPal
- New York Times
- Kayak
- Delta.com
- Etsy
- Gap.com
- svpply
- Google.com


Then answers these questions:
- How would you define a web app? A web site?

- Describe what reasons you would choose to make a certain product into a web site, a web app, or a native app.




### Go Over Wireframes in Groups



### User Flows

- Go over [a shorthand for designing UI flows](http://37signals.com/svn/posts/1926-a-shorthand-for-designing-ui-flows)


- Go through example: Amazon?


- Have students read [Keeping the goal in sight while designing component flows](http://feltpresence.com/articles/17-keeping-the-goal-in-sight-while-designing-component-flows)

- Discuss:
	- What was Ryan Singer trying to do on the website (ie. What was his objective?)? (to watch a video online)
	- What was the website he was using try to get him to do (ie. What was the site's implied objective)? (to have users log in or create accounts)
	- How did Ryan propose solving it? (Instead of having user reset password, just send a verification email to the user, then let them proceed from there straight to the video)
	- What did he see as the core reason that the site didn't do this to begin with? (Basic requirements are set out, and then split for separate people to tackle. UX and user flow were separated)


- Take what you learned and now lets make some user flows (20 minutes)





HW
---------------------------------------

1. **Read [Keeping the Goal in Sight While Designing Component Flows](http://feltpresence.com/articles/17-keeping-the-goal-in-sight-while-designing-component-flows)**

	It's short! We'll talk about it next class, so make sure you read it. 


2. **Component/User Flows**

	Using the method that Ryan Singer pointed out in today's article, draw out the user flows for at least the three main forms of interaction that your site will have. If your users have a lot of options or choices at a given point, try your best to get all of them, but go for the options that are most common.


3. **Mood Boards**

	Create a mood board that has at least thirty (30) pieces of inspiration and/or attributes that you want to include in your site designs. These should include font choices, color palettes, imagery, and at least three websites that have features or styles that you want to borrow from. I don't want you just copying what other people have done, but you might as well try to imitate the features that make a good design look good.


4. **Website Review**

	Find a site that exhibits what you think of as good web design, and write ten things you like about it. You can comment on aesthetics, usability, interesting navigation structures, typographyâ€¦ whatever. Post your synopsis along with a working link and as many screenshots as necessary to demonstrate your points.
