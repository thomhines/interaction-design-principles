Day 3
=======================================

1. Sites vs. Apps
2. User Flows




PREP
---------------------------------------
- Bring up links in browser




CLASS
---------------------------------------


### Quiz

- What are two features of a web app?
- What are two features of a web site?
- What are the advantages of each? And of a native app?




### Go Over Wireframes in Groups






### User Flows

- Go over [a shorthand for designing UI flows](http://37signals.com/svn/posts/1926-a-shorthand-for-designing-ui-flows)


- Have students read [Keeping the goal in sight while designing component flows](http://feltpresence.com/articles/17-keeping-the-goal-in-sight-while-designing-component-flows)

Students can go on break after they finish the article.


###### Break 







- Discuss:
	- What was Ryan Singer trying to do on the website (ie. What was his objective?)? (to watch a video online)
	- What was the website he was using try to get him to do (ie. What was the site's implied objective)? (to have users log in or create accounts)
	- How did Ryan propose solving it? (Instead of having user reset password, just send a verification email to the user, then let them proceed from there straight to the video)
	- What did he see as the core reason that the site didn't do this to begin with? (Basic requirements are set out, and then split for separate people to tackle. UX and user flow were separated)


- Go through example: Buying a book on Amazon

	- Write down process in words
	- Convert into user flow

Have students work on this in class.







HW
---------------------------------------

Designing with personalization in mind? How can people customize their experience?


1. **Website Review**

	Find a site that exhibits what you think of as good web design, and write ten things you like about it. You can comment on aesthetics, usability, interesting navigation structures, typography… whatever. Post your synopsis along with a working link and as many screenshots as necessary to demonstrate your points.


2. **Pick Three Personas**

	Define three imaginary people who can embody the various needs your users might have. Try to pick people who aren't the same. No matter how simple your site is, no doubt people use it for different reasons. Make your personas different enough that you build a web app that *really* meets your users needs.


3. **Written User Steps**

	Without going into specific button clicks and form fields, describe what the user is doing and why they're doing it, from beginning to end. If there are multiple ways a user can use your site, go through each process individually.


4. **Component/User Flows**

	Using the method that Ryan Singer pointed out in today's article, and your written user steps, draw out the user flows for at least the three main forms of interaction that your site will have. If your users have a lot of options or choices at a given point, try your best to get all of them, but go for the options that are used by the most users. Too much detail—it it makes your user flows confusing, for instance—can sometimes be worse that too little.


5. **Mood Boards**

	Create a mood board that has at least twenty (20) pieces of inspiration and/or attributes that you want to include in your site designs. These should include font choices, color palettes, imagery, and at least three websites that have features or styles that you want to borrow from. I don't want you just copying what other people have done, but you might as well try to imitate the features that make a good design look good.
