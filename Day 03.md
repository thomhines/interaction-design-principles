Day 3
=======================================

1. Sites vs. Apps
2. User Flows




PREP
---------------------------------------
- Bring up links in browser




CLASS
---------------------------------------


### Quiz

- What is a persona?
- From the [reading we did in class](http://feltpresence.com/articles/17-keeping-the-goal-in-sight-while-designing-component-flows), what was wrong with the login process that Ryan Singer dealt with?
- Where did Ryan think that these problems came from (whose fault were they)?
- What was his proposed solution? Why didn't the people who made the website do that?

From [Principles of Interface Design](http://bokardo.com/principles-of-user-interface-design/):
- What is the most important job of any interface? (Clarity)
- What is the purpose of any interface (to enable interaction or to be used; to accomplish something)
- How should we use color in our interfaces (to highlight, not determine)
- What is progressive disclosure? (Showing only the information they need to know when they need to know it)



### Test Out User Flows
- Creators will create list of three or more tasks that each user is supposed to complete
- Students pair off and try out each others apps, trying to reach each goal one at a time (maybe without restarting the app?)
- Creators will keep quiet unless to ask a question
- Testers will describe what they're doing out loud, especially when they are feeling stuck
- 4 minutes for taking notes after each test, and debrief. Creator can now talk through their thinking, but only in order to get more feedback or ideas

HW
---------------------------------------

Hey all,

It was fun playing with your apps today! Great work, and great feedback from the testers/observers. 

Here's your homework for Wednesday. My homework emails always look long, but this stuff shouldn't take you more than 2-3 hours. It's OK to work quick and messy right now!


1. **Sign up and be a test user**

	Join [Enroll](http://www.enrollapp.com/) and complete a test or two. You might not be able to do any of the test paid tests (you get invited to these, and they don't happen often), but there are practice tests you can do. 


3. **3 Sets of Wireframes**
	
	I want to see three distinct directions. You don't have to design the login screens or anything else that you'll see in most other apps, but I do want to see the layout and core interactions for the main aspects of your app.

	Consider different layouts, different interactions, and different affordances in each direction. Minimum of 5 frames per direction (15 frames total), and don't waste time on details or anything that won't help you get your ideas down on paper.


2. **Improve Your User Flow**

	Using the best ideas of your wireframes and the fantastic feedback you got today in class, update your click prototypes (POP). You may want to update your three test objectives so that they can be more specific when users are testing. For instance, if you want a user to test a search feature, give them something to search for and then make sure there is something in your app that has that name (eg. search for "To Kill a Mockingbird", and include that title in your list)



4. **Annotated Mood Boards**

	Create a mood board that has at least twenty (20) pieces of inspiration and/or attributes that you want to include in your app designs. These should include font choices, color palettes, imagery, and at least 3-5 websites or apps that have features or styles that you want to borrow from. I don't want you just copying what other people have done, but you might as well try to imitate the features that make a good design look good. Then add notes as to WHY you like each item, and HOW the designer made it so successfully.
