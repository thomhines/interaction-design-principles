### Sites vs. Apps

Split students into groups and have them discuss whether or not these things are sites or apps:

- Dropbox
- Pirate Bay
- Netflix
- Hulu
- Flickr
- Tumblr
- WordPress
- Evernote
- Mint
- PayPal
- New York Times
- Kayak
- Delta.com
- Etsy
- Gap.com
- svpply
- Google.com


Then answers these questions:
- How would you define a web app? A web site?

- Describe what reasons you would choose to make a certain product into a web site, a web app, or a native app.




### Go Over Wireframes in Groups



### User Flows

- Go over [a shorthand for designing UI flows](http://37signals.com/svn/posts/1926-a-shorthand-for-designing-ui-flows)


- Go through example: Amazon?


- Have students read [Keeping the goal in sight while designing component flows](http://feltpresence.com/articles/17-keeping-the-goal-in-sight-while-designing-component-flows)

- Discuss:
	- What was Ryan Singer trying to do on the website (ie. What was his objective?)? (to watch a video online)
	- What was the website he was using try to get him to do (ie. What was the site's implied objective)? (to have users log in or create accounts)
	- How did Ryan propose solving it? (Instead of having user reset password, just send a verification email to the user, then let them proceed from there straight to the video)
	- What did he see as the core reason that the site didn't do this to begin with? (Basic requirements are set out, and then split for separate people to tackle. UX and user flow were separated)


- Take what you learned and now lets make some user flows (20 minutes)
